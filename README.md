**Project Overview**

The Baobab Genome Project focuses on the genetic exploration of _Adansonia digitata_ (African baobab) populations in Kenya. This project aims to create a genomic resources, covering the full geographic and genetic diversity of baobab populations within the country. By sequencing and analyzing DNA samples, we aim to answer key questions about the evolutionary history, population genomics, and adaptive traits of this ecologically and culturally important species.


**Objectives**
1. DNA Repository: Establish a genomic DNA repository for A. digitata in Kenya, representing diverse populations across coastal and inland regions.
2. Genomic Research: Facilitate future research on the evolutionary history, population structure, and adaptive mechanisms of baobabs.
3. Conservation: Provide genetic material for conservation efforts and management strategies, contributing to the species' long-term survival.
4. Biotechnological Applications: Support biotechnological research aimed at improving baobab agronomic traits, such as drought tolerance and nutritional quality.

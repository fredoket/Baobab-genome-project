**Project Overview**

The Baobab Genome Project focused on strengthening the foundational framework for the advancement of _Adansonia digitata_ (African baobab) genomic research in Kenya. This project was aimed at establishing genomic resources for baobab varieties, by creating genomic DNA repository for future scientific ivestigation, identifying baobab tissues suitable for extracting high molecular weight genomic DNA and assembling whole nuclear and chloroplast genome of baobab. This will provide adequate information to help answer fundamental questions in the tree's evolutionary history, population genomics, and landscape adaptation.


**Objectives**
1. DNA Repository: Establish a genomic DNA repository for _A. digitata_ varieties in Kenya.
2. Genomic Research: Facilitate future research on the evolutionary history, population structure, and adaptive mechanisms of baobabs.
3. Conservation: Provide genetic material for conservation efforts and management strategies, contributing to the species' long-term survival.
4. Biotechnological Applications: Support biotechnological research aimed at improving baobab agronomic traits, such as drought tolerance and nutritional quality.
